    <h1>The Mutt Build System</h1>
    <p>
      Mutt is the recommended way to build Mutiny projects. Not only does it abstract between
      quirks of multiple C++ compilers but it also provides iterative builds and could potentially be
      used to generate code using many of the tools provided by the engine.
