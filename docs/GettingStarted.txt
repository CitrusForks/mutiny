Getting Started
===============

Getting Mutiny up and running is quick and simple. The main step is compiling
Mutt, the Mutiny build system.  The commands needed for this step are listed
below.

Steps for Linux and Mac OS X
----------------------------

Check out the code from the repository or extract from tarball. Open up a
command prompt and do the following:

  $ cd <path to mutiny>
  $ cd bootstrap
  $ ./bootstrap.sh

Steps for Windows
-----------------

Check out the code from the repository or extract from tarball. Open up a
command prompt and do the following:

  > cd <path to mutiny>
  > cd bootstrap
  > bootstrap.bat

Compiling a Project
===================

Now that Mutt has been built, we can now go on to building and running one of
the sample projects.

Steps for Linux and Mac OS X
----------------------------

  $ cd samples/experiment
  $ ../../bin/mutt
  $ build/linux/bin/experiment

Steps for Windows
-----------------

  > cd samples\experiment
  > ..\..\bin\mutt
  > build\windows\bin\experiment

After the project is built and running successfully, now we can move on to
creating a new project from scratch.
